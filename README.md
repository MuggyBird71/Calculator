## Overview

**Project Title**: Command-Line Calculator Application

**Project Description**: 
This project is a command-line calculator application written in C++. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also maintains a history of all calculations performed during the session and allows the history to be saved to and loaded from a file. The application demonstrates the use of C++ classes, inheritance, virtual functions, and STL data structures.

**Project Goals**:
- To demonstrate understanding and application of basic C++ concepts.
- To implement a functional command-line calculator.
- To practice using classes, inheritance, and virtual functions.
- To use STL data structures and file I/O operations.

## Instructions for Build and Use

### Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd calculator-app
Build the project using the provided Makefile:
bash
Copy code
make
Run the executable:
bash
Copy code
./bin/calculator
Instructions for using the software:
When prompted, enter an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) or 'q' to quit.
Enter two numbers to perform the chosen operation.
View the result displayed on the screen.
Repeat steps 1-3 as needed. Enter 'q' to quit the application.
The history of all calculations will be displayed and saved to history.txt.

Future Work
The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

 Implement additional mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
 Enhance error handling and input validation.
 Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator.
 Add support for saving and loading multiple history files.
